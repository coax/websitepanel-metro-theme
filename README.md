How to
-----
Ready to install this theme in your WebsitePanel? Firstly, make note this project is under development, so not all pages are redesigned. Secondly, you'll need modern browser IE 11+, Firefox, Chrome or Opera to display CSS3 properly.

Download the theme in ZIP - you'll see "Download ZIP" button in lower right corner.
After you've downloaded the theme, unpack it and copy to your WebsitePanel Portal installation dir (eg. "C:\WebsitePanel\Portal\") and overwrite directories when prompted.

A IIS restart is recommended so you release cached copy of WSP and have Metro theme in drop-down at login page.
